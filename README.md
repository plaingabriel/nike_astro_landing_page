# Project to practice tailwind, cloning a project from the JS Mastery Tailwind course, using Astro ðŸš€

I recreate the Nike Landing Page made by JS Mastery on his Tailwind YouTube course. I make the most part of the code for my own in order to practice Tailwind without needing to use the tutorial.

I copy his tailwind config and images. In the same way, when I was stuck on the code I review the original repository to fix the problem ðŸ˜…

Also, I take inspiration from the repo of Shivam Upadhyay

They used React to make this project but I decided to use Astro ðŸš€, I think that is better because the page itself doesn't have very interactivity

ðŸ”— Watch the original course of JS Mastery [here](https://youtu.be/tS7upsfuxmo?si=5F0z3Fu57Pb2eav1)

ðŸ”— Also [check his code](https://github.com/adrianhajdin/nike_landing_page)

ðŸ”— And the [repo of Shivam](https://github.com/SHVM-09/tailwind-with-vite)

ðŸ˜‰ And if you liked my repo, give me a star ðŸŒŸ :D
